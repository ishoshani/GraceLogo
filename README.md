# GraceLogo
This is a simple Dialect Library for grace for implementing turtle graphics and restricting user to just that!

Full User Documentation at : http://ishoshani.github.io/GraceLogo2/

This Library is dependent on the Grace objectDraw library, found at https://github.com/gracelang/objectdraw

The minigrace webclient comes with objectdraw, but for offline options you'll need to get that working first.

If something goes wrong there may have been a change in objectdraw. Just throw up an issue if so!

Summary of features:

-Turtle Graphics

-Restrictions on Variables and Definitions to Static Numbers, Booleans, and Strings

-Restrictions on defining classes
